## Features

1. **Token Counting**
   - Total tokens
   - Input tokens
   - Output tokens

2. **Cost Calculation**
   - Based on the token usage and model pricing

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Time taken for each call
   - CPU and memory consumption

4. **Environmental Impact**
   - Estimated COâ‚‚ emissions

5. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive logs of all operations

6. **Visualization**
   - CLI summaries
   - Streamlit dashboard for detailed insights
